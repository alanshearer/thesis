  abstract = {Stereo acoustical echo cancellation is a highly challenging application
	in the field of acoustical signal processing. Unlike the single-channel
	case, conflicting requirements on the adaptive filters make this
	problem ill-posed in its original formulation. In this contribution,
	it is shown how introducing an estimate of the Common Acoustical
	Poles of the receiving room can lead the adaptive system to remarkable
	performance improvements with respect to the classical implementation.
	Finally, a detailed comparison between the two schemes is presented,
	based on a simulated acoustical environment and the use of the classical
	affine projection algorithm.},

  abstract = {This chapter aims at introducing an Independent Component Analysis
	(ICA) approach to the separation of linear and nonlinear mixtures
	in complex domain. Source separation is performed by an extension
	of the INFOMAX approach to the complex environment. The neural network
	approach is based on an adaptive activation function, whose shape
	is properly modified during learning. Different models have been
	used to realize complex nonlinear functions for the linear and the
	nonlinear environment. In nonlinear environment the nonlinear functions
	involved during the learning are implemented by the so-called “splitting
	functions”, working on the real and the imaginary part of the signal.
	In linear environment instead, the “generalized splitting function”
	which perform a more complete representation of complex function
	is used. Moreover a simple adaptation algorithm is derived and several
	experimental results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of
	the proposed method.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes the Blind Separation of complex signals using
	a novel neural network architecture based on an adaptive non-linear
	bi-dimensional activation function; the separation is obtained maximizing
	the output joint entropy. Avoiding the restriction due to the Louiville’s
	theorem, the activation function is composed by a couple of bi-dimensional
	spline functions, one for the real and one for the imaginary part
	of the signal. The surface of this function is flexible and it is
	adaptively modified according to the learning process performed by
	a gradient-based technique.
	
	The use of the bi-dimensional spline defines a new class of flexible
	activation functions which are bounded and locally analytic. This
	paper aims at demonstrate that this novel bi-dimentional complex
	activation function outperforms the separation in every environment
	in which the real and the imaginary part of the complex signal are
	not decorrelated. This situation is realistic in a large number of
	cases.},
